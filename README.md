# Tracking-APIs-OpenCV
There are many object tracking methods. We 'll explore few of these easy to use Object Tracking APIs. 

## Purpose 
A simple tutorial of how object tracking are implemented on any object that we choose.

### we will be using some built-in algorithms in OpenCV, such as:
- Boosting Tracker
- Multiple Instance Learning Tracker (MIL)
- Kernelized Correlation Filters Tracker (KCF)
- Tracking, Learning and Detection Tracker (TLD)
- MedianFlow Tracker
